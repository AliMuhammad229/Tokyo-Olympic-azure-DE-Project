# Tokyo Olympics 2020 Data Analytics Project on Azure Data Engineering
## Exciting Achievement Unveiled: Successfully Navigating the Azure Data Engineering Project with Tokyo Olympics 2020 Data! 🏅🚀
### I am thrilled to announce the success of the Azure Data Engineering Project, a remarkable journey that delved into the intricacies of handling real-world data from the Tokyo Olympics 2020. 🎉

## Step 1: Embarking on the Data Odyssey with Azure Data Factory 🌐🚀
### I used Azure Data Factory to extract data from the Kaggle (Tokyo Olympics 2020) load it on the GitHub repository and load it into Azure Data Lake Gen2.


## Step 2: Unleashing the Spark of Transformation with Azure Databricks and PySpark 🔮🔥
### I used Azure Databricks and PySpark for transformations on the data and stored it in another container on Azure Data Lake Gen2.


## Step 3: Illuminating Insights through Azure Synapse Analytics Alchemy 💡🔍
### Connected Azure Data Lake Gen2 to Azure Synapse Analytics Workspace and did some SQL operations to gain insights from the data. 💡


## Step 4: Crafting Data Symphonies with Azure Synapse Workspace, Power BI, and Tokyo Olympics 2020 Insights 🎨📊
### I connected Azure Synapse Workspace to Power BI Desktop and created a dashboard that shows the trends and patterns of the Tokyo Olympics 2020 activity. 📊



### Step 5: I published the dashboard to Power BI App Services. 🌐
